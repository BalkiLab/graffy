Graffy is a open source Graph Library written completely in C++. It was primarily developed at the Information Security Lab, Supercomputer Education Centre at the Indian Institute of Science for use by Network Science researchers. Several routines support shared memory parallelization via OpenMP and graphs of the order of 100 million edges have been processed. It currently contains code for 

1. Reading and Writing from multiple graph formats.

2. Basic Graph Traversal, Connected Components and Paths

3. Centrality Measures

4. Community Detection Algorithms - both Global and Local and measures to evaluate community detection algorithms

5. Artificial Graph Generators
